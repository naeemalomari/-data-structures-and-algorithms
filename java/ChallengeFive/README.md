# 5.Singly Linked List
Singly linked lists contain nodes which have a data field as well as 'next' field, which points to the next node in line of nodes.
## Challenge And API
1. A Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.
2. LinkedLink Class, that contains:
- A head property.
- Insert method -> Adds a new node In the beginning of the LinkedList.
- Includes method -> Indicates whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.
- to string -> Returns: a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:
  "{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"
## Approach & Efficiency :
- I used while loops in each method which takes space : O(1) and time: O(n)
